# website-monitor-buddy

I am interested in developing a website monitoring service. This service will allow users to track changes on various websites. Here are the key features I envision:

User Accounts: Users can create an account using their email and password. Each account will have its own unique list of websites to monitor.
Website List: Users can add or remove websites from their list. Each website on the list is associated with its HTML content.
Frequency Setting: Users can set a specific frequency at which the service checks for changes on each website in their list.
Change Sensitivity: Users can define a threshold for the number of character changes in the HTML content of a website that constitutes a significant change.
Email Notifications: If a websiteâ€™s HTML content changes significantly (i.e., it deviates by more than the set threshold of characters), the service will send an email notification to the userâ€™s registered email address.
Each userâ€™s list is independent, allowing for personalized website monitoring. Make the UI clear and easy to see. 

## Collaborate with GPT Engineer

This is a [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)-synced repository ðŸŒŸðŸ¤–

Changes made via gptengineer.app will be committed to this repo.

If you clone this repo and push changes, you will have them reflected in the GPT Engineer UI.

## Setup
